To do lab4, all you need is this repo.
And the `/home/ff/cs152/sp21/lab4-install` folder which provides:
* riscv toolchain
* spike

The lab4-install will be put as
`/Dropbox/shared/courses/ucb/CS152/cs152_sp23_lab4/lab4-install.tgz`

Make sure you put them into a `centos 7` box.
I have verified with a `CentOS minimal 7` VM.
